# GithubApp

This GitHub app is built on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, taking full advantage of SwiftUI and Combine. MVVM ensures a clean and testable data flow, seamlessly connecting the view layer to the view model layer. Leverage SwiftUI's data binding capabilities for a robust and intuitive user interface. The MVVM pattern enhances testability, making it easy to write unit tests and maintain a scalable codebase.
