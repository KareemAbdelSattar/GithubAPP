## Architecture and Design Decisions

- **SwiftUI:** Utilizes SwiftUI for building the user interface, taking advantage of its declarative syntax.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern for clean separation of concerns.
- **Combine Framework:** Integrates Combine to handle asynchronous and event-driven code.
- **Network Layer:** Implements a well-designed network layer for efficient API communication.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Unit Tests:** Enhance the codebase by adding unit tests to ensure the reliability of the application.
- **Coordinator Pattern:** Consider implementing the Coordinator pattern for improved navigation if the application complexity grows.
- **Repository Pattern:** Introduce the Repository pattern if local data storage becomes a requirement in the future.
